### python game project made for Python Programming class at FII, UAIC

In the main menu, the user can choose to see the instructions or start a game either with the pc, or with a friend besides him.

The first approach I took was using pygame, but that didn't work out because of the workarounds needed for buttons so I took another shoot and now the GUI is made using tkinter.

- the instructions button will open up a wikipedia web bage with the game rules
- other options will start a game either player vs player or player vs pc

For the actual game, the scene will look something like this:

The ideal dimmensions for the pieces should be 60x60 so they would fit like on a real life backgammon board.

Disclaimer: all UI/UX used was found in a form or another on the internet and I altered and edited it based on my and the project needs.
