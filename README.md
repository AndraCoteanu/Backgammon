Requirements:
- GUI for backgammon game
- playable in 2 modes:
  - player vs player
  - player vs PC

Besides the requirements, I added the "How to play" button which sends the user to an wikipedia page about backgammon.

Here are some videos that show how this app works:

More information about the development of the game are written in the source code as PEP documentation.

Disclaimer: all UI/UX used was found in a form or another on the internet and I altered and edited it based on my and the project needs.
